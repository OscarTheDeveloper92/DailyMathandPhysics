Reviewed simple harmonic motion and oscillations.

6/30/25
Completed reviewing simple harmonic motion regarding the block mass and spring system as well as the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs with respect to time. Also wrote down the elements that make up simple harmonic motion
such as frequency, period, amplitude, and restoration force. Then I reviewed vectors as they pertain to Calculus 3. My last subject of study for the day was inductance and its application in Transformers.
